    CVE-2021-42574 & CVE-2021-42694: Trojan Source (CVSS 8.3)

    These CVEs describe attacks where malicious Unicode bidirectional control
    characters or homoglyphs hide malicious code from human reviewers while
    compilers/interpreters execute it.

    Why NOT applicable to mermaid-mcp:

    1. STRICT SECURITY MODE: We explicitly configure Mermaid with
       securityLevel: "strict" which encodes all HTML tags in text and
       completely disables click handlers - no JavaScript execution path exists.

    2. DOMPURIFY SANITIZATION: Mermaid uses DOMPurify to sanitize all output,
       stripping dangerous elements (script, iframe, object, embed) and
       event handler attributes (onclick, onerror, onload, etc.).

    3. OUTPUT IS STATIC SVG: This tool renders diagrams to static SVG images.
       Even if LLM-generated input contains Unicode tricks, the sanitized
       output cannot execute code.

    4. ATTACK VECTOR MISMATCH: Trojan Source requires a human code review
       deception -> compilation/execution flow. A diagram renderer has no
       such flow - input is sanitized, output is an image.
